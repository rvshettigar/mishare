{"name":"Mishare","body":"#Mishare.rb\r\n\r\nMishare (pronounced my-share) is a command line interface for Amazon S3, Dropbox, Cloudapp and Imgur using Ruby and the AWS SDK for Ruby.\r\n\r\nYou need xclip, ruby and gems instaled to use this. \r\n\r\n**Warning: This project is pre-alpha and while you can use it, I would advise caution since there may be kinks. One probable issue you may have is : GMail and Cloudapp passwords are stored in files using symmetrical encryption, and this is certainly not ideal! You should change the SECRET_KEY constant to your choice of secret key used for the encryption. I haven't found time to implement GMail OAuth yet, so you're welcome to fork and send in a pull-request.**\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n\r\nThe shell-file install shown below installs ruby1.9.1, rubygems(and a few gems: list is below) and xclip. I suggest you check out the script for yourself before running anything.\r\n\r\n### One-line Install (Ubuntu)\r\n    \r\n    curl https://raw.github.com/hardikr/mishare/master/install.sh | sh\r\n\r\n### Manual Install\r\nIf you want to manually install everything, or for other operating systems, check below:\r\n\r\n#### 1) Installing Requirements (for Ubuntu)\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install xclip\r\n    sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1\r\n    curl http://production.cf.rubygems.org/rubygems/rubygems-1.8.12.tgz --O rubygems-1.8.12.tgz\r\n    tar -xzvf rubygems-1.8.12.tgz\r\n    cd rubygems-1.8.12\r\n    sudo ruby setup.rb\r\n    \r\n    sudo gem install json\r\n    sudo gem install rest_client\r\n    sudo gem install cloudapp_api\r\n    sudo gem install highline\r\n    sudo gem install encrypted_strings\r\n    sudo gem install aws-s3\r\n    sudo gem install mail\r\n    sudo gem install ruby-gmail\r\n    sudo gem install dropbox-sdk\r\n    sudo gem install gpgr\r\n    \r\n#### 2) Grab the script, copy to /usr/bin and make it executable.\r\n\r\n    curl https://raw.github.com/hardikr/mishare/master/mishare.rb --O mishare\r\n    sudo cp mishare.rb /usr/bin/mishare\r\n    sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/mishare\r\n\r\n#### 3) Now run the script.\r\n    \r\n    mishare\r\n\r\nIt should prompt you for credentials as and when it requires them.\r\n\r\n## Note\r\n\r\n*   The script defaults to S3, so there is no flag/switch for it.\r\n*   The URL is copied to clipboard by default.\r\n*   Amazon S3 assumes overwrite to true, by default.\r\n*   Dropbox assumes overwrite to false, by default.\r\n*   Use `-g` for GPG encryption. This uses the `gpgr` gem, which is jusn a wrapper over the system gpg binary, which should be installed in `/usr/bin/gpg` \r\n*   When using the `-e` flag for email, the script assumes you're using the public key of the same email address you've provided with -e flag, so you can use the -g option as a switch. If you provide a value to the -g flag, it will be ignored. For Example, in the below command, the file is encrypted and sent using `john@doe.com`'s public key, and `jane@doe.com` is ignored:\r\n\r\n        mishare ul -f file.txt -e john@doe.com -g jane@doe.com # uses john@doe.com's public key\r\n        mishare ul -f file.txt -e john@doe.com -g              # right\r\n    \r\n*   When not emailing the file, you need to provide at least one email address after `-g` flag (else script will return an error):\r\n\r\n        mishare ul -f file.txt -g john@doe.com  # works\r\n        mishare ul -f file.txt -g               # error\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n### Upload a file\r\n\r\n    mishare ul -f file.txt\r\n    \r\n### Upload and email\r\nUpload a file and email it to john@doe.com\r\n\r\n    mishare ul -f file.txt -e john@doe.com\r\n\r\n### Generate torrent\r\nGenerate public torrent URL for file.txt (S3 ONLY)\r\n\r\n    mishare torrent -f file.txt\r\n\r\n### Generate expiring link\r\nGenerate public authenticated URL that expires after 180 seconds and email it to john@doe.com (S3 ONLY)\r\n\r\n    mishare expire -f file.txt -t 180 -e john@doe.com\r\n\r\n### Upload to Dropbox\r\nUpload file.txt to Dropbox and email it to john@doe.com and jane@doe.com | \r\nFlag : `-d`, `--db`\r\n\r\n    mishare ul -f file.txt -e john@doe.com jane@doe.com -d\r\n\r\n### Upload to Cloudapp\r\nUpload file.txt to Cloudapp and email it to john@doe.com and jane@doe.com | \r\nFlag : `-c`, `--cl`\r\n\r\n    mishare ul -f file.txt -e john@doe.com jane@doe.com -c\r\n\r\n### Upload to imgur.\r\nUpload file.jpg to Imgur (works on images only) | \r\nFlag : `-i`, `--imgur`\r\n\r\n    mishare ul -f file.jpg -i\r\n\r\n### Encrypt file \r\nEncrypt using public keys of john@doe.com and jane@doe.com | \r\nFlag : `-g`, `--gpg`\r\n\r\n    mishare ul -f file.txt -g john@doe.com jane@doe.com\r\n    \r\n### Encrypt and email \r\nEncrypt and email file to john@doe.com (will use public key of john@doe.com) | \r\nFlag : `-g`, `--gpg`\r\n\r\n    mishare ul -f file.txt -e john@doe.com -g\r\n    \r\n## Command and Flag Help\r\n    **COMMANDS**\r\n     ul:     Uploads a file to an S3 bucket. \r\n               USAGE: mishare ul -f FILE [-e EMAIL1,EMAIL2... ]\r\n     expire: Generate expiring link to a file with time in seconds.
